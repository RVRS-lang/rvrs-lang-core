## 🗓️ 2026-06-05 — Local Environment Recovery & Continuation

### ✅ Summary
- Successfully rebuilt the RVRS development environment following a full workstation recovery
- Restored core development tooling:
  - Git
  - GHCup
  - GHC 9.6.7
  - Cabal 3.14.2.0
  - Haskell Language Server
  - VS Code integration
- Migrated `cabal.project` away from local Ya path dependencies
- Replaced local dependency references with Git-based `source-repository-package` entries
- Confirmed successful retrieval of:
  - `ya`
  - `ya-world`
  - `ya-ascii`
  - `ya-literal`
- Advanced the build process beyond dependency acquisition and into RVRS source compilation

### 🧠 Current State Assessment
RVRS remains structurally intact following recovery.

Confirmed project assets:

- ✅ Documentation set preserved
- ✅ Parser architecture preserved
- ✅ Unified AST preserved
- ✅ Ya integration preserved
- ✅ Typechecking infrastructure preserved
- ✅ Runtime / Engine architecture preserved
- ✅ Test runners preserved
- ✅ Standard library preserved

Current repository status:

- Active repository: `RVRS-lang/rvrs-lang-core`
- Active branch: `setup/use-git-ya-deps`

### ⚠️ Current Build Blocker
The build now fails within RVRS source code rather than environment setup.

Current blocker:

```text
src/RVRS/Syntax/Operation.hs
```

Missing symbols:

```text
Instead
Twice
```

Likely caused by upstream Ya API changes since the last known stable RVRS build.

### 📊 Recovery Status

Environment:
- ✅ Recovered

Dependencies:
- ✅ Recovered

Source Compilation:
- ⚠️ Blocked

Tests:
- ⏳ Pending

Documentation:
- ✅ Preserved
- ⏳ Review Needed

### 🧭 Recovery Phase Priorities
- [ ] Restore successful compilation
- [ ] Investigate `RVRS.Syntax.Operation`
- [ ] Recover test execution
- [ ] Verify compatibility with current Ya ecosystem
- [ ] Review and update documentation
- [ ] Establish a new stable baseline before feature development

### 🌊 Project Reflection

RVRS has transitioned from an infrastructure recovery problem to a source compatibility problem.

This marks the completion of the environment rebuild phase and the beginning of the continuation phase.

The immediate goal is no longer restoring tooling, but restoring confidence in the codebase itself through successful builds, test recovery, and architectural review.

  - `source` top-level definitions with type expectations  
- Validated early enforcement in both source and IR evaluators  
- Confirmed that type mismatches raise runtime errors

## 🧭 v0.5.0-alpha – Flow Arguments & Expr Calling  
**📅 Date:** 2025-05-06  
**🔖 Tag:** v0.5.0-alpha

✅ Summary:
Flows can now take arguments and return values. Expressions can call flows directly (e.g. `call myFlow(1, 2)`). This unlocks real composability between flows and introduces full test coverage for argument binding, expression math, shadowing, branching, and flow result usage.

🔨 Core Changes:
- AST updated to support `CallExpr name [Expr]`
- Parser supports flow calls in both statement and expression form
- Evaluator binds argument values and executes in scoped environments
- Return values from flows can now be used in expressions (e.g., `source result = call myFlow()`)

🧪 Tests:
- ✅ `arg_bind_test.rvrs`
- ✅ `full_test.rvrs`

🎯 Next Goals:
- Type annotation enforcement
- Argument count validation errors
- Standard library flows: `bless`, `mirror`, `curse`

## 🌀 v0.4.0-alpha — The River Speaks  
**Date:** 2025-05-03  
**Tag:** v0.4.0-alpha

RVRS now supports **poetic delta syntax** — allowing declarations like:

```rvrs
delta silence "The river asks no questions"
```

No equals sign required. This unlocks a new expressive mode for writing RVRS flows in symbolic, lyrical form.

### 🔧 Changes:
- `deltaParser` now accepts both `delta x = ...` and `delta x "..."` forms
- Poetic flows now fully parse and evaluate
- `.gitignore` updated to cleanly exclude build artifacts

### ✅ Verified:
- `examples/poetic/rvrs.rvrs`: poetic flow chain
- `examples/full_test.rvrs`: full feature regressiong

## 🧭 v0.3.5-alpha — Stable Parser + Full Flow Execution

**Date:** 2025-05-01  
**Tag:** `v0.3.5-alpha`

✅ **Today’s Achievements:**
- Isolated and fixed critical `delta` parsing bug (`unexpected 'd'`)
- Implemented `NumLit Double` + `parseNumber` to support both `1` and `1.0`
- Verified parser is wired into `Main.hs` with debug trace
- Validated all core features with `full_test.rvrs`:
  - Flow definitions
  - `source` and `delta`
  - `echo`, `mouth`, `return`
  - Nested flow calls via `call` and `CallExpr`
  - Scoped environments + shadowing
  - Branch logic (`branch ... else ...`)
  - Arithmetic expressions (+ - * /)
- Cleaned `.cabal` and archived legacy `MiniParser`

🔖 Tagged: `v0.3.5-alpha` — first stable public-ready snapshot.

---

**Next Steps (Planned for v0.3.6+):**
- 🧠 Add support for flow **arguments** (e.g., `flow greet(name: Text)`)
- 🔁 Implement **loops or recursion** (starting with manual tail call)
- 🧪 Add **unit test file runner** (like `rvrs test/`)
- 🧰 Begin prepping **codegen or Aiken output**
- 🏗 Optional: add **type checking / validation**

## 🧭 v0.3.1-alpha – Scoped Branches & Variable Shadowing
**Date:** 2025-04-30

**Tag:** `v0.3.1-alpha`

✅ Summary:
RVRS now supports lexical scoping inside branches, including proper variable shadowing.

🔍 Scope Achievements:
Variables defined inside branch blocks are scoped locally

Variables declared outside remain unaffected after branch exit

Shadowing (re-declaring the same variable name) behaves correctly

Confirmed with multiple passing tests

🔬 Verified Tests:
scope_test.rvrs: confirms isolation of variables in branches

shadowing_test.rvrs: confirms that inner x does not overwrite outer x

## 🧭 v0.3.0-alpha – Multi-Flow River Paths  
**Date:** 2025-04-28  
**Tag:** `v0.3.0-alpha`

### ✅ Summary:
RVRS now supports multiple `flow` blocks per file, with a formal entrypoint flow (`main`).  
Flows can call one another using `call <name>`, allowing modular logic structures.

### 🔨 Core Changes:
- Parser now accepts many flows from a single source file.
- `evalFlow` updated to receive a flow environment (`Map String Flow`) for linking.
- `Call` now exists as a **statement**, not an expression.
- Added support for empty argument lists in `flow()` declarations.
- `Main.hs` upgraded to build a flow map and run the `"main"` flow.

## 🧭 v0.2.0 – Flow Foundations  
**Date:** 2025-04-27  
**Tag:** `v0.2.0`

### ✅ Summary:
Core control flow in RVRS is now implemented and stable.  
The `mouth` keyword halts a flow immediately and optionally returns a value.

### 🔨 Core Changes:
- `Mouth` returns and halts the flow using `Returned` type.
- `evalBody` short-circuits on `Returned`.
- `Echo`, `Mouth`, and `Return` all unified under a clean result model.
- Added `formatVal` helper for consistent output.

---

## 🧭 v0.1.0 – First Watershed  
**Date:** 2025-04-25  
**Tag:** `v0.1.0`

### ✅ Summary:
Initial prototype of the RVRS interpreter.  
Supports basic expressions, flow blocks, echo statements, and evaluation.

### 🔨 Core Features:
- Parser and AST scaffolded with `Flow`, `Echo`, `Expr`, and simple arithmetic.
- Basic environment for variable handling with `source` and `delta`.
- First evaluator logic with runtime expression handling.
