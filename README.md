**“Not all contracts are code. Some are rivers.”**

RVRS is an experimental smart contract language for Cardano.  
It treats code as ritual. Every contract is a flow: deliberate, symbolic, and evolving.

RVRS is written in **Haskell**, fully custom, and compiles to an Intermediate Representation (IR) designed for [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org).  
It is still forming. Still flowing.

### ✨ The Core 6

These elemental constructs shape every ritual:

- `flow`: A container of purpose and invocation  
- `source`: A declaration of origin, a variable spring  
- `delta`: A transformation, a shift in state  
- `branch`: A decision point — a fork in the current  
- `mouth`: A voice — the moment the contract speaks  
- `echo`: A return, the final reflection  

These are the riverbed. The rest flows from here.

### ✅ Built So Far (v0.9.0-alpha)

RVRS now supports typed declarations, scoped evaluation, branching, flow composition, and evaluation tracing.

#### 🌐 Language Features
- ✅ Core 6 syntax and flow-based semantics
- ✅ Expression parsing + arithmetic and logic ops  
- ✅ Flow-to-flow calls with argument passing  
- ✅ Typed `delta` and `source` declarations (`delta x: Num = 5`)  
- ✅ Scoped variables, shadowing, and purity by default  
- ✅ Echo-based return system and optional `mouth` tracing  
- ✅ Multi-flow files, `main` entrypoint, and standard rituals  

#### ⚙️ Runtime & Engine (current)
- ✅ Engine-first evaluator executing the recursive AST
- ✅ Built on Ya (**Я**) principles with a compatibility/interop layer
- ✅ Scoped flows and deterministic execution (early return, shadowing, etc.)
- ✅ Static typechecking
  - Expressions: stable
  - Statements & declarations: in progress
- ✅ Test runners for engine execution and typechecking (positive & negative cases)
- ✅ Standard library merged at startup
- ✅ Tooling: parser, pretty-printer, and syntax/value layers

### 🧪 Sample Flow

```rvrs
flow giveDiscount {
  return 0.1
}

flow computeTotal {
  source base = 100
  delta discount = call giveDiscount
  source total = base - (base * discount)
  mouth "start"
  echo total
}
```

```
mouth: start  
echo: 90.0
```

### 🔁 Why Aiken First?

RVRS is designed to compile into [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org), Cardano’s strongly typed smart contract language.

- **Structured Output**: Aiken gives RVRS a clear, functional target  
- **Faster Dev**: Easier than writing directly in Plutus Core  
- **Type Safety**: Aiken’s type system complements RVRS  
- **Ecosystem Fit**: Great dev tools and growing Cardano community

📂 See [`examples/transpilation`](./examples/transpilation) for sample flows and Aiken targets.

🎨 **Philosophy**

RVRS is a language of calm. A language of meaning.

- Symbolism over syntax  
- Readability as ritual  
- Clear evaluation and flow  
- Inspired by rivers, nature, and the act of naming
